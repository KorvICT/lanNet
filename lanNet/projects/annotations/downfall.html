          It was the toughest track to put in. <br>
          It was honest, brash, a little spiteful, even."

          More often than not, I would look at my reflection and say, <br>
          'You're killing yourself mentally, and for what? Someone's approval?'. <br>
          Lzzy's chorus on the original is one of my favourite off 'General Admission'."

          It sucks, but I learned to stop giving a fuck. <br>
